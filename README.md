# RedStone Multi Blockchain Protocol

## How it will work?
RedStone Protocol is a network made of peer-to-peer parallel blockchains. RedStone achieves the highest scalability ever via a sharded setup. For our implementation of sharding, a transaction will be sent by a user to the chain with the least amount of pending transactions. There will be three or more chains to make transactions execute smoother and faster, thereby reducing transaction times. Every block in every chain will have the merkle root of the previous block from all chains, securing the whole network.
Please note this is currently still a thesis and NOT a tested system. If you have any ideas or concerns please open an issue.
